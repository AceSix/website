# C++ Guidelines For Stencil Code

## Syntax & Semantics

### Use Pointers Instead of C Arrays

Always use pointers instead of C arrays. This is especially relevant when dealing with `QImage`'s data.

```cpp
std::uint8_t[] arr // bad
std::uint8_t*  ptr // good
```

To access elements:

```cpp
*(ptr + 1) // good
ptr[1]     // good
```

### Prefer Brace Initialization Over Parenthesis Initialization

In general, most of your variable declarations should look like this:

```cpp
auto x1 = Type{}; // good
Type x2 = Type{}; // good
```

We advise against the following:

```cpp
auto y = Type(); // bad
Type z{}; // ugly, but okay
Type w(); // very bad: this does not create a variable w.
          // it declares a function w() which returns an instance of Type.
          // this is known as the "most vexing parse" in C/C++
```

### Avoid Using Constructors Where Possible

If your class/struct has a construction/initialization process which requires functionality beyond just `x = y, z = w, ...`, use an explicit initialization member function instead.

This has to do with certain hard-to-debug bugs that might appear when both (1) using value semantics (passing things around by value) and (2) defining some, but not all, of a class/struct's special member functions (constructor, destructor, etc).

```cpp
// good
auto x = ComplicatedThing{param1, param2, param3};
x.initializeSubThing(); // <-- some complex operation must be done, before it can be used
```

### Prefer Range-For For Looping Over Containers

```cpp
// good
for (auto& x : container)
  // something involving x

// bad, unless you need i elsewhere in the loop
for (auto i = 0; i < container.size(); ++i)
  // something involving container[i]
```

### Use `auto`

Feel free to use type deduction, e.g. `auto myVariable = myValue`, within function bodies.

Avoid using them in function signatures where an explicit type could be used instead.

### Use Type Aliases

In the event that writing a long, explicit type annotation (as opposed to `auto`) is unavoidable, feel free to use a type alias instead:

```cpp
// bad: not very readable
std::vector<std::array<SuperLongTypeName, 123>> variable

// good
using InnerType = std::array<SuperLongTypeName, 123>;
using ContainerType = std::vector<InnerType>;
auto variable = ContainerType{};
```

## Naming & Documentation

### Consider Your Target Audience

Use names that would be clear to students at the **expected level of knowledge** _at or before_ the start of the assignment.

E.g. if you are writing a lab that comes much earlier than the OpenGL parts of the course, avoid introducing the term "shader" in a function/variable name, as students may not appreciate its significance. Worse, they may develop an incorrect understanding of it, which they'll have to unlearn later.

### Generally, Use Names That Describe Purpose, Not Implementation

Use names that describe the **purpose or intent** of the object.

Do not use names that describe its underlying implementation, unless:

1. The underlying implementation is the thing that students are meant to learn / interact with, OR
2. There are multiple implementations of the same thing, and the names help to juxtapose them.
   - e.g. `dfs()` and `bfs()`.

### Be Wary Of Abbreviation

Avoid creating **uncommon abbreviations** by deleting letters within a word.

That said, there are plenty of acceptable abbreviations, so use your own judgement (and refer to the next subsection on [verbosity vs visibility](#err-on-the-side-of-verbosity)):

```text
obj: object
col: column
mat: matrix
vec: vector
vert: vertex
dist: distance
```

Additionally, all acronyms must have the same case.

```cpp
printVAO(); // good
printVao(); // bad
```

### Err On The Side Of Verbosity

Do not worry about saving horizontal space, as it is far more important to make your code immediately understandable by a student.

Generally speaking, **descriptiveness should be proportional to the name's scope of visibility**: e.g. `n` may be a fine name within a 5-line function, but within the scope of a class, it's likely too vague.

```cpp
// good
std::tuple<int, int> countLeafAndNonleafNodes(MyTreeType& ast);

// bad: no one will understand why there are two return values
std::tuple<int, int> countNodes(MyTreeType& ast);
```

### Comment Your Functions

Some software developers in industry prefer keeping inline comments to a minimum, as they are a crutch for bad naming and factorization/abstraction.

That said, we are writing code for students, not industry professionals, so **comment your functions**. Keep it short and simple, and follow the same guidelines as above.

```cpp
// good
// Returns the number of leaf and non-leaf nodes in a given MyTreeType
std::tuple<int, int> countLeafAndNonleafNodes(MyTreeType& ast);

// bad: implementation detail is irrelevant, and comment is getting too long
// Uses DFS to iterate through nodes of given MyTreeType ast, then returns a
// tuple containing the count of leaf nodes and the count of non-leaf nodes,
std::tuple<int, int> countLeafAndNonleafNodes(MyTreeType& ast);
```
