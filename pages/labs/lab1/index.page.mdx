# Lab 1: Setup

[Gradescope link](https://github.com/BrownCSCI1230/lab01_setup)

This lab is due on **Sep 13, 2022**.

## 0. Intro

Welcome to CS123!

$$
  \displaylines{ \text{We love math!} \\ \text{But math doesn't love us...} }
$$

Here's the lighting equation:

$$
  I_位 = K_a O_{a位} + \sum_{m=0}^{n_\text{lights}-1} \left[ I_{m位} \cdot (k_d O_{d位} \hat{n}) \cdot \hat{L_m} \right]
$$

The purpose of this lab is twofold: to help you get set up to work locally, and to help you learn the basics of C++, the programming language that we'll be using in this class.

In the rest of this 1-2h lab, you will:

1. Install Qt and QtCreator locally,
   - Learn to nest lists
   - Like this
   - It just _works_!
     - hehe
     - `:wink:` becomes :wink:
2. Build and run a starter Qt program, and
3. Gain some familiarity with basic C++ features.

### 0.1. Dummy

If you know what you're doing, you <i>can</i> write code in your preferred IDE or text editor. Do note, however,
that our course uses a standardized environment for grading&mdash;that is to say, we will build and run your
projects through QtCreator. Therefore, you'll probably want to have Qt and QtCreator, if only to test that your
code works as expected!

## 1. Qt and QtCreator

In CS123, we use **Qt** and **QtCreator** to develop, build, and run all our projects and labs.

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io) is a software used for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and cross-platform applications, e.g. for smart TVs or in-vehicle displays.
- [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) is the integrated development environment (IDE) included with each Qt install. It provides useful tools for developing in C++, which you'll learn about later in the course.

### 1.2. The QtCreator Interface

If you completed all the steps successfully, you should see the following screen. Good work!

[Insert labelled image here]

- [Include something about "Project View"]
- [Include something about "Projects" aka settings]
- [Include something about "Run"].

When you're ready, hit "run" and proceed to the next section.

[ Note to TAs: we can make this project run some kind of setup check ]

```cpp {7-9} showLineNumbers
auto Plus(auto Increment) {
  return [=](auto x) {
    return x + Increment;
  };
}

auto Apply(auto Operation, auto x) {
  return Operation(x);
}

auto x = Apply(Plus(20), 22); // x == 42
auto y = Apply(Plus(-1.1), 4.24); // y == 3.14
```
